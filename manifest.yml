  This app will launch a VNC server on a **login node**.

  Note, you're limited to one instance at the time. If the "Launch" button is
  disabled please refer to your active session found under _"My Interactive
  Sessions"_ above.
  
  _There might be a slight delay where the button is disabled while
  the check for active sessions is underway._
